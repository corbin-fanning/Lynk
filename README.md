This is the code for our App Lynk my team from Aggies in Tech are creating. This is code that I collaborated on with four others. 
It is not the complete MVP but is the start which I am super excited for!

Here is some mock-up of the app that was done on figma and which we are replecating the look and feel on XCode

I worked on the Edit profile page along with added a database. We plan to implement Google Firebase in the final product.
For the MVP we plan to either implement Firebase or go simplier with a JSON file.
